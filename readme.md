# Three.js Simple Space Flight Simulator

This is the most basic features to simulate a flight travel into space :  
  
* A spaceship you can move into space with keyboard arrow keys, spacebar to move foward and ctrl to move backward  

* The moving pattern in the same as a joystick : to go to the left, you have to rotate first by press left arrow, then actually go the left by pressing down.. to go up.. so to the left because you're rotated.. :D  

* A third-person camera which follows the spaceship and rotates with it when moving up and down but not when rotating left & right   

* Some particles to simulate stars 

To go further, feel free to modify physics with velocity, add a model, asteroids, maybe lasers. 

If you find improvements, let me know, and enjoy coding
